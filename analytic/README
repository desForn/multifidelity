INFO:
    This programs construct a series of Smolyak approximation surrogates of
    analytical functions to validate theoretical convergence bounds.

    The interpolation_* programs perform a monofidelity approach while the
    quadrature_* use several multifidelity schemes.

INSTALL:
    Run make from the current directory.

OUTPUT:
    After running any of the interpolation_. or quadrature_. programs,
    in the .dat files the cost and error of each step of the surrogate
    construction is shown.
