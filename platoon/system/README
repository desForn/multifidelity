FILE STRUCTURE:
    The snapshots data is stored in ../data. Here we included only one
    snapshot as example to save space.

    The qoi extracted from all the data is stored in ./data in binary format.

INSTALL:
    Run the following commands from the current directory:
        make
        cd mesh_displacement
        wmake

    NOTE: wmake is an OpenFOAM command

RUN:
    The surrogates are constructed as follows:
        ./platoon_truncation [n_levels]
        ./platoon_richardson_extrapolation [n_levels]

    n_levels is optional. If given the surrogate will add adaptively n_levels
    and then stop. If not, the surrogate will keep adding levels until it
    lacks some snapshots. In this case, the to compute them are automatically
    generated.

    The surrogate is represented in the files platoon_cs.dat,
    where c ∈ {d, s, l} stands for the component of the force (drag, side and
    lift) and s ∈ {0, 1, 2} stands for the leading vehicle geometry

    In convergence.dat the cost and estimated relative error of each step is
    shown.
