FILE STRUCTURE:
    Two directories are present, one for the remeshing method and one for the
    mapping. The snapshots are stored in
        ../remeshing/data
        ../mapping/data
    We included only one snapshot as example to save space.

INSTALL:
    Run the following commands from the current directory:
        make
        cd mesh_displacement
        wmake

    NOTE: wmake is an OpenFOAM command

RUN:
    To construct the surrogate run:
        ./smolyak_approximation ../remeshing/system/data [n_levels]
        or
        ./smolyak_approximation ../mapping/system/data [n_levels]

        This will construct the surrogate until n_levels are added (if the
        n_levels parameter is provided) or some unavailable snapshots
        are required. They will be listed in ./missing_data.dat

        surrogate.dat is a file with the QoI as a function of the theta parameter
        sampled for 2000 points.

    To compute the missing snapshots:
        cd ../remeshing/system
        bash snapshot.sh [fidelity_level] [angle_index]
        or
        cd ../remeshing/system
        bash snapshot.sh [fidelity_level] [angle_index]

        After new snapshots are computed, update the data files by running the
        following command from the present directory
            ./collect_data ../remeshing/
