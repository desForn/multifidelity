INFO:
    This programs construct a multifidelity Smolyak approximation of the drag
    force acting on a rotated square on small Reynolds number.

    The goal of the example is to show that a remeshing process may introduce
    spurious oscillations on the multifidelity surrogate.

FILE STRUCTURE:
    Two directories are present, one for the remeshing method and one for the
    mapping. The snapshots are stored in
        ../remeshing/data
        ../mapping/data
    We included only one snapshot in each data folder as example to save space.
    The QoI of all computed snapshots is at ../[remeshing or mapping]/system/data

    Additional snapshots may be computed running 
        bash ../[remeshing or mapping]/system/snapshot.sh arg0 arg1

INSTALL:
    Run the following commands from the current directory:
        make
        cd mesh_displacement
        wmake

    NOTE: wmake is an OpenFOAM command

RUN:
    To construct the surrogate run:
        ./smolyak_approximation ../[remeshing or mapping]/system/data [n_levels]

        This will construct the surrogate until n_levels are added (if the
        n_levels parameter is provided) or some unavailable snapshots
        are required. They will be listed in ./missing_data.dat

        surrogate.dat is a file with the QoI as a function of the theta parameter
        sampled for 2000 points.

    To compute the missing snapshots:
        cd ../remeshing/system
        bash snapshot.sh [fidelity_level] [angle_index]
        or
        cd ../remeshing/system
        bash snapshot.sh [fidelity_level] [angle_index]

        After new snapshots are computed, update the data files by running the
        following command from the present directory
            ./collect_data ../remeshing/
